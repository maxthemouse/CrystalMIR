    "# Stitching Images\n",
    "The results of multiple vertical scans are to be stitched together to form a picture. The various images are stitched after processing into absorption, refraction and scattering images. In a perfect system the images could be simply put together in a montage. In practice there is some variation of the values. When the images are taken there is some overlap between the images. In stitching we will do two things.\n",

    "1. Use a background area such as air or the plastic holder as a reference. The values of the background should be the same in all images.\n",
